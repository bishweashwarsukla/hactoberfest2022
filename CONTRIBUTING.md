# Contribution Rules :books: :

- You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just merge it :)
- Do NOT add any build steps e.g npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site),
- Do NOT remove other content.
- Styling/code can be pretty, ugly or stupid, big or small as long as it works.
- Add your name to the contributorsList file.
